Privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where you live.</p>

					<h2>3.	Collecting information and use</h2>
					<p>3.1	Personal Information: We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal and professional information: </p>
						<p class="subpara">(a)	[information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this platform (including [your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views and platform navigation paths])];</p>
						<p class="subpara">(b)	[information that you provide to us when registering with our platform (including [your email address])];</p>
						<p class="subpara">(c)	[information that you provide when completing your profile on our platform (including [your name, profile pictures, gender, date of birth, relationship status, interests and hobbies, educational details and employment details])];</p>
						<p class="subpara">(d)	[information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our email notifications and/or newsletters (including [your name and email address])];</p>
